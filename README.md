The data is preprocessed by separating features and the target variable. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Random Forest Classifier model is initialized and trained on the training set. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report, showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. The achieved results indicate a high accuracy of 98.4%, with detailed classification metrics for the binary target variable, demonstrating good predictive performance on the provided dataset.
